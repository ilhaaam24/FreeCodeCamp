            In this article we will say hello to React. We'll discover a little bit of detail about its background and use cases, set up a basic React toolchain on our local computer, and create and play with a simple starter app — learning
            a bit about how React works in the process.

          <p>
            As its official tagline states, React is a library for building user interfaces. React is not a framework – it's not even exclusive to the web. It's used with other libraries to render to certain environments. For instance,
            React Native can be used to build mobile applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            To build for the web, developers use React in tandem with ReactDOM. React and ReactDOM are often discussed in the same spaces as — and utilized to solve the same problems as — other true web development frameworks. When we refer
            to React as a "framework", we're working with that colloquial understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            React's primary goal is to minimize the bugs that occur when developers are building UIs. It does this through the use of components — self-contained, logical pieces of code that describe a portion of the user interface. These
            components can be composed together to create a full UI, and React abstracts away much of the rendering work, leaving you to concentrate on the UI design.
          </p>
        </section>

          <header>Use cases</header>
          <p>
            Unlike the other frameworks covered in this module, React does not enforce strict rules around code conventions or file organization. This allows teams to set conventions that work best for them, and to adopt React in any way
            they would like to. React can handle a single button, a few pieces of an interface, or an app's entire user interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            While React can be used for small pieces of an interface, it's not as easy to "drop into" an application as a library like jQuery, or even a framework like Vue — it is more approachable when you build your entire app with React.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, many of the developer-experience benefits of a React app, such as writing interfaces with JSX, require a compilation process. Adding a compiler like Babel to a website makes the code on it run slowly, so developers
            often set up such tooling with a build step. React arguably has a heavy tooling requirement, but it can be learned.
          </p>
          <p>This article is going to focus on the use case of using React to render the entire user interface of an application with the support of Vite, a modern front-end build tool.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="How_does_React_use_JavaScript">
          <header>How does React use JavaScript</header>
          <p>
            React utilizes features of modern JavaScript for many of its patterns. Its biggest departure from JavaScript comes with the use of JSX syntax. JSX extends JavaScript's syntax so that HTML-like code can live alongside it. For
            example:
          </p>
          <code
            >const heading =
            <h1>Mozilla Developer Network</h1>
            ;
          </code>
          <p>This heading constant is known as a JSX expression. React can use it to render that <> tag in our app.</p>
          <p>Suppose we wanted to wrap our heading in a header tag, for semantic reasons? The JSX approach allows us to nest our elements within each other, just like we do with HTML:</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Setting_up_your_first_React_app">
          <header>Setting up your first React app</header>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Exploring_our_first_React_component">
          <header>Exploring our first React component</header>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Moving_on_to_main">
          <header>Moving on to main</header>
           <p>Let's open src/main.jsx, because that's where the <App /> component is being used. This file is the entry point for our app, and it initially looks like this:</p>

          <p>As with App.jsx, the file starts by importing all the JS modules and other assets it needs to run.</p>
          <p>The first two statements import the React and ReactDOM libraries because they are referenced later in the file. We don't write a path or extension when importing these libraries because they are not local files. In fact, they are listed as dependencies in our package.json file. Be careful of this distinction as you work through this lesson!</p>
          <p>We then import our App() function and index.css, which holds global styles that are applied to our whole app.</p>
          <p>We then call the ReactDOM.createRoot() function, which defines the root node of our application. This takes as an argument the DOM element inside which we want our React app to be rendered. In this case, that's the DOM element with an ID of root. Finally, we chain the render() method onto the createRoot() call, passing it the JSX expression that we want to render inside our root. By writing <App /> as this JSX expression, we're telling React to call the App() function which renders the App component inside the root node.</p>
          <p>You can read up on these React APIs, if you'd like:</p>

          <header>Practice with JSX</header>
          <p>Next, we'll use our JavaScript skills to get a bit more comfortable writing JSX and working with data in React. We'll talk about how to add attributes to JSX elements, how to write comments, how to render content from variables and other expressions, and how to pass data into components with props.</p>

          <p>This brings us to the end of our initial look at React, including how to install it locally, creating a starter app, and how the basics work. In the next article, we'll start building our first proper application — a todo list. Before we do that, however, let's recap some of the things we've learned.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Components can import modules they need and must export themselves at the bottom of their files.</li>
            <li>Component functions are named with PascalCase.</li>
            <li>You can render JavaScript expressions in JSX by putting them between curly braces, like {so}.</li>
            <li>Some JSX attributes are different than HTML attributes so that they don't conflict with JavaScript reserved words. For example, class in HTML translates to className in JSX.</li>
            <li>Props are written just like attributes inside component calls and are passed into components.</li>
          </ul>
